<h1>Carrot cake recipe</h1>
  
Step 1. We prepare the grated ingredients in bowl 1
100 g walnuts (common walnuts or pecans, finely roasted in a frying pan)
300 g carrot (in the processor, I have to do it in batches of 50%)
Grated zest of 1 orange

Preheat the oven to 180ยบ.

Step 2. Prepare the dry ingredients in bowl 2.

320 g of wheat flour for pastry
180 g brown sugar
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tablespoon of baking powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1 pinch of salt

Step 3. We make the mixture. In the bowl 2 we incorporate:
200 ml of oat milk
25 ml of orange juice
150 g sunflower oil
1 tsp vanilla essence
 all the contents of bowl 1
1 tsp vinegar

Step 4. Bake the mixture in the oven
Once all the ingredients are well mixed, we incorporate the dough into the removable baking pan, previously prepared with baking paper.
Let it bake in the lower tray at 180ยบ for about 50 minutes.
To know if it is done, prick the cake with a long toothpick and if it comes out dry, it is done.

Step 5. Remove from the mold and let it rest. Make the frosting of your choice.
