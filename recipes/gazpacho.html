<h1>Gazpacho recipe</h1>
<p><b>Step 1. Prepare the cucumber.</b>
<p>Peel 30 g - 40 g of cucumber and let it soak to reduce its strength so it is not indigestible.</p>
<p><b>Step 2. In the glass of the food processor, incorporate:</b></p>
<p>900 g of ripe tomato branch, without the part of the stalk, cut into a few pieces so that it is better crushed by the food processor, but without removing the skin. This is about 5 medium sized tomatoes.</p>
<p>9 g of coarse salt</p>
<p>50 grams of red bell pepper stripped and cleaned (about 1/3 of a medium-sized bell pepper)<p>
<p>20 grams of Italian green bell pepper.</p>
<p>5 g of garlic peeled and without germ</p>
<p>50 g extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p>The cucumber from the previous step, drained and deseeded</p>
<p><b>Step 3. Process and emulsify</b></p>
<p>Start beating on the first speed for about 2 or 3 minutes.</p>
<p>When the ingredients begin to be well blended, increase to the second speed.</p>
<p>Add 500 ml of cold water</p>
<p>Lower to first speed and add 50 g of extra virgin olive oil very slowly, adding a trickle of oil.</p>
<p>Let it process for half a minute more and turn it off.</p>
<p><b>Step 4. Pass through a fine strainer</b></p>
